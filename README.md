# zigape

Fast cross-plasform event loop library. It provides non-blocking TCP/UDP sockets, websocket, timers and dns resolution.
Original implementation was written in C (libapenetwork). This repository is an attempt at providing Zig bindings and "Zig idiomatic" interfaces.

⚠️ **Work in progress**
